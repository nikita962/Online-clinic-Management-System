				<strong><h3>1.Tips to deal with a dry mouth</h3></strong>

				<p>
				<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
				<li>Limit your caffeine intake Caffeine absorbs the saliva in your mouth and makes it drier.</li>
				<li>Chew on sugar-free gum: Sucking on sugar-free hard candies or chewing sugar-free gum stimulates your salivary glands and increases the flow of saliva in your mouth.</li>
                <li>Avoid sugary and acidic food and drinks: Acidic and sugary food need more saliva to digest, while drinks that fall in this category might refresh and hydrate you temporarily, but they leave your mouth feeling drier after some time.</li>
                <li>Try a fluoride rinse. This is a method that doctors recommend to get rid of the problem of a dry mouth. Learn to breathe through your nose instead of your mouth.</li>
                <li>Avoid using decongestants and antihistamines that are available over the counter at your nearest pharmacy.</li>

				<strong><h3>2.Ways to Control Thyroid</h3></strong>
				<p>
				<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
				<li>Vitamin A<br>The best way to control your thyroid is to incorporate Vitamin A in your daily life routine. All you need to do is to consume food products that are high in Vitamin A. The most common Vitamin A rich foods are; yellow and green veggies, carrots, eggs, apricots, spinach, carrots, etc.</li>
                 <li>Eat mindfully<br>Your thyroid is located in your throat area and it serves as a connection between your mind and your body. So, what happens when you eat fast is that the food reaches the stomach quickly before your body and mind can react to it. This way, you end up eating too much which is definitely not a healthy habit.</li>
                 <li>Mobile phones<br>We are all addicted to our phones these days. However, your mobile phone is a radiation machine and when you hold it to your ears, it affects your thyroid as well. Therefore, use earphones and keep your phone away from yourself when you sleep.</li>
                 <li>Yoga<br>There are several yoga asanas that help stimulate and support your endocrine system. Also, physical activity boosts the supply of oxygen in your body which will help your thyroid tremendously. Another advantage of doing yoga is that you can practice it easily at home or basically anywhere. You don not need expensive machines or a gym membership for yoga.</li>
                 <li>Avoid smoking<br>Thiocyanate and nicotine in cigarettes can increase excretion of iodine, which affects the performance of your thyroid. So, quit smoking!

				<strong><h3>3.Tips to Manage Asthmad</h3></strong>
				<p>
				<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
				<li>1. Asthma Triggers<br>Identification of Asthma triggers is the most important step in the management of asthma. A trigger is anything that irritates the airways and leads to an asthma attack. It can differ from person to person and season to season. Some of the most common triggers include allergens (including dust mites, pollens, cockroaches, medicines, moulds, animal dander and saliva, etc., viral infection (flu and common cold), irritants (perfumes, aerosols, smoke, paint fumes, hair spray, and air fresheners), weather changes, exercise, and breathing in cold air. Identifying these triggers is a hard task. But once the task is done, you can make some changes in the environment around you.</li>
				<li>2. Action Plan<br>Make an asthma action plan for yourself. An action plan is a detailed outline written by you or your doctor. It includes details on how to react if certain symptoms appear, or how to take medications, or what to do if an asthma attack is imminent. The albuterol inhaler is the one drug that you should always keep with yourself. This rescue inhaler can get you a quick relief.</li>
				<li>3. Get rid of the mites<br>Dust mites are the most common allergen. You should buy dust proof zipped covers for your pillows and mattress. Avoid any down pillows or comforters. Every week, you should wash your sheets as well as the mattress. Instead of using carpets, which attracts dust, get a hardwood or tile floor. Stay away from stuffed animals as they are home for dust mites or anything that can hold dust.</li>
				<li>4. Breathing tools and tests<br>The doctors usually use a spirometer to measure the amount of air inhaled or exhaled in a given amount of time. However, everyone cannot afford to put a computerized machine at home. So, you can use a peak flow meter that measures the breathing capability. It can detect even minute changes in the airway including any obstruction or inflammation. It can even detect a drop 2-3 days before the flare up, giving sufficient time to prepare.</li>
				<li>5. Exercise<br>For people with asthma, it is very important that they are physically active. It improves blood flow and capacity of the lung. However, many people think that strenuous activities will lead up to an asthma attack. There are some tips that you can use to exercise without showing any asthma symptom. People with asthma should take a 30 minute long brisk walk. Make a self-management plan and involve activities like yoga, martial arts, swimming, tramping. Just remember to take at least 2 puffs of the medicine before you start exercising.
